## Introduction
We propose an alternative simple local operation, called
PlaneConv, which can extract local geometric features from point clouds by
learning a set of planes in Rn space. The proposed architecture tackles both
point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Moreover, each module is
designed to be permutation invariant. PlaneConv has a simple theoretical analysis and is easy to incorporate into deep learning models to improve their performance.

Here we list the commands for training/evaluating PlaneNet on classification and segmentation tasks on multiple datasets.

* ##### Classification
  * ##### ModelNet40
  * ##### MNIST
  
* ##### Segmentation
  * ##### ShapeNet
  * ##### S3DIS

## Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3
- CUDA 8.0 or higher
- [tensorflow 1.4 or higher](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup)
- Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.

This code has been tested with Python 3.5, Tensorflow 1.2 and CUDA 8.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. The code have also been tested on Windows 10 with python 3.5-3.7, tensorflow 1.4(or higher), cuda 9 (or higher)  and cudnn 6.0 (or higher).
 notice ; If u want compile with tensorflow 2.0 please change import to:
```
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()
```   
To train a model, firstly download the data that explain on the folder 'data'
## Point Cloud Data
You can get sampled point clouds of ModelNet40 (XYZ and normal from mesh, 10k points per shape) at this <a href="https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_normal_resampled.zip">link</a>.</br>

Mnist: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pcAJa9TereursFkXfXLXiXkfawUv8Uid/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</br>

The ShapeNetPart dataset (XYZ, normal and part labels) can be found <a href="https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/shapenetcore_partanno_segmentation_benchmark_v0_normal.zip">here</a>.</br>

S3DIS will be added.</br>
Uncompress the downloaded data in this directory.
